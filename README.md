Integration happiness library (IHL): Output processor extension 
=========

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/UpdateExpress/OutputProcessorExtension.svg)](https://gitter.im/UpdateExpress/OutputProcessorExtension?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) [![License LGPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPLv3-green.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)

## Overview

Incredibly easy way to output result from DataCompositionSchema into json, xml, etc format. Output result is arranged in the same way as SpreadsheetDocument. It's easy to start using it with any configuration on "1C:Enterprise 8" platform (version 8.3.6 and higher).

You can start with a simple setup. Main usage scenarios: 

- output reports in json, xml, etc.
- integration with different business intelligence systems
- export data with arbitrary hierarchy
- export data to json, xml, etc.  
- creation of messages for message exchange systems
- *...and so on*

Installation
-------------

IHL extension is available as configuration. You can install it using command ```1C:Enterprise 8 -> Designer -> Configuration -> Compare and merge with configuration from file...```. 


Usage
------

**Fast output**

Output with using additional objects (tree, structures, arrays). It causes increased use of memory.

```1C-Enterprise
Function OutputInJSON(DataCompositionSchema, DataCompositionSettings)
    
    DataCompositionTemplate = IHLDataComposition.NewDataCompositionTemplateParameters();
    DataCompositionTemplate.Schema   = DataCompositionSchema;
    DataCompositionTemplate.Template = DataCompositionSettings;
    
    OutputParameters = IHLDataComposition.NewOutputParameters();
    OutputParameters.DCTParameters = DataCompositionTemplate;
    OutputParameters.CanUseExternalFunctions = True;
    
    StreamObject = DataProcessors.DataProcessorJSON.Create();
    StreamObject.Initialize();
    StreamObject.WriteStartObject();
	
    IHLDataComposition.Output(Undefined, StreamObject, OutputParameters, False);
    
    StreamObject.WriteEndObject();
    Result = StreamObject.Close();
	
    Return Result;
    
EndFunction // OutputInJSON()    
```

**Sequential output**

Sequential output is 22.53% slower than fast output, although it has light memory usage.

```1C-Enterprise
Function OutputInJSON(DataCompositionSchema, DataCompositionSettings)
    
    DataCompositionTemplate = IHLDataComposition.NewDataCompositionTemplateParameters();
    DataCompositionTemplate.Schema   = DataCompositionSchema;
    DataCompositionTemplate.Template = DataCompositionSettings;
    
    OutputParameters = IHLDataComposition.NewOutputParameters();
    OutputParameters.DCTParameters = DataCompositionTemplate;
    OutputParameters.CanUseExternalFunctions = True;
    
    StreamObject = DataProcessors.DataProcessorJSON.Create();
    StreamObject.Initialize();
    StreamObject.WriteStartObject();
	
    IHLDataComposition.Output(Undefined, StreamObject, OutputParameters, True);
    
    StreamObject.WriteEndObject();
    Result = StreamObject.Close();
	
    Return Result;
    
EndFunction // OutputInJSON()     
```


Questions? Problems?
---------------------

Open-source projects develop more smoothly when discussions are public.
